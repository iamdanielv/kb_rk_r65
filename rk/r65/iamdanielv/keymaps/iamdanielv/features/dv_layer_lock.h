// 2025 DV (@iamdanielv)
// based on https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/layer-lock
// While playing with the original Layer Lock library, I found that it was not
// working for layers that were toggled. This modified version of the library
// takes into account toggled layers and considers them locked.
// This allows us to toggle the layer on and off and use the layer lock key.

// I also noticed that the original library only considered the top most layer
// and toggled it's lock state. I've added some code to check from which layer
// the lock key was pressed and lock/unlock that layer.

// I prepended all function names with 'dv' to make sure I am calling the updated
// functions and not the original ones.

/**
 * @file layer_lock.h
 * @brief Layer Lock, a key to stay in the current layer.
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * @note Layer Lock is now a core QMK feature! See
 * <https://docs.qmk.fm/features/layer_lock>
 *
 * Layers are often accessed by holding a button, e.g. with a momentary layer
 * switch `MO(layer)` or layer tap `LT(layer, key)` key. But you may sometimes
 * want to "lock" or "toggle" the layer so that it stays on without having to
 * hold down a button. One way to do that is with a tap-toggle `TT` layer key,
 * but here is an alternative.
 *
 * This library implements a "Layer Lock key". When tapped, it "locks" the
 * highest layer to stay active, assuming the layer was activated by one of the
 * following keys:
 *
 *  * `MO(layer)` momentary layer switch
 *  * `LT(layer, key)` layer tap
 *  * `OSL(layer)` one-shot layer
 *  * `TT(layer)` layer tap toggle
 *  * `LM(layer, mod)` layer-mod key (the layer is locked, but not the mods)
 *
 * Tapping the Layer Lock key again unlocks and turns off the layer.
 *
 * @note When a layer is "locked", other layer keys such as `TO(layer)` or
 * manually calling `layer_off(layer)` will override and unlock the layer.
 *
 * Configuration
 * -------------
 *
 * Optionally, a timeout may be defined so that Layer Lock disables
 * automatically if not keys are pressed for `LAYER_LOCK_IDLE_TIMEOUT`
 * milliseconds. Define `LAYER_LOCK_IDLE_TIMEOUT` in your config.h, for instance
 *
 *     #define LAYER_LOCK_IDLE_TIMEOUT 60000  // Turn off after 60 seconds.
 *
 * and call `layer_lock_task()` from your `housekeeping_task_user()` in
 * keymap.c:
 *
 *     void housekeeping_task_user(void) {
 *       layer_lock_task();
 *       // Other tasks...
 *     }
 *
 * For full documentation, see
 * <https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/layer-lock>
