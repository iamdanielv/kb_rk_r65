# RK ROYAL KLUDGE R65 - üöß Custom QMK firmware

I bought this keyboard from amazon:
[RK ROYAL KLUDGE R65](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNP1BG1W?th=1)

It quickly became one of my favorite keyboards, it's a great size and even has a knob! ([Hipyo Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@HipyoTech) would be proud)

Similarly to [my GK61](https://github.com/iamdanielv/kb_gk61), I wanted to program it.

Getting the original source for the firmware was not easy, but I found [@irfan](https://github.com/irfanjmdn/r65) had started the ball rolling over on Discord.

## Custom Keyboard Software

Since I don't have the original source, I decided to create a new folder called `iamdanielv` that could be put into the qmk repo `keyboard` directory and not mess anything up when/if the original source is added later.

Copy the folder structure from `rk\r65\iamdanielv` into the qmk repo `keyboard` directory.

## ü•≥Thanks!

Thanks to [@irfan](https://github.com/irfanjmdn/) for getting the ball rolling on getting the PCB and source code.

Thanks to [sdk66](https://github.com/sdk66/) for providing a lot of samples and guidance.
The [Tide65 code base](https://github.com/sdk66/qmk_firmware/tree/wireless/keyboards/epomaker/tide65) was very helpful in getting a lot of things figured out.

## ‚å®Ô∏è New Keymap

I've updated the **default** keymap to work with the current source. It can be used as a starting point for customization.

I created a **new keymap** `iamdanielv` that enables via, function keys, navigation, a num pad and layer for RGB / Keyboard management.

I use `6 layers` for my changes, `keyboard.json` specifies that in the following section:

```json
"dynamic_keymap": {
    "layer_count": 6
}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Compiling

You can now use QMK builder with the following command:

```shell
qmk compile -j 0 -kb rk/r65/iamdanielv -km iamdanielv
```

> the `-j 0` uses parallel build to speed it up a bit

qmk should generate a new bin file: `rk_r65_iamdanielv_iamdanielv.bin` in your qmk_firmware folder.

For me it was: `C:\Users\<USER>\qmk_firmware\rk_r65_iamdanielv_iamdanielv.bin`

I've included a version of [my custom firmware](extras/rk_r65_iamdanielv_iamdanielv.bin) that works well for me. There you will also find the [original firmware](extras/original_rk_r65_firmware.hex) in case something goes horribly wrong.

- [Original](extras/original_rk_r65_firmware.hex)
- [Custom](extras/rk_r65_iamdanielv_iamdanielv.bin) - **Note:** I disabled VIA to make it smaller, but it can be enabled by compiling this repo.

## üåê Using via

In order to use via, you may have to upload the [json specification](extras/rk_r65_via.json), it can be found under the `extras` folder.

## ü•æ Bootloader and Clearing eeprom

To prevent accidental KB Bootloader triggers, I have it hidden under a layer.

- To reboot and `enter bootloader mode`:
  - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
  - OR hold `RAlt`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
  - OR hold `CAPS Lock`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `q` key
  - OR hold `RAlt`, then double tap `PgDn`, then triple tap the `q` key
- To `clear eeprom`:
  - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key
  - OR hold `RAlt`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key
  - OR hold `CAPS Lock`, then hold `RShift`, then triple tap the `z` key
  - OR hold `Ralt`, then double tap `PgDn`, then triple tap the `q` key

## ‚≠ê Features

I use a `control layer` to modify the keyboard settings.

To enable the control layer
- Momentary - will be deactivated as soon as you release `Right Shift`:
    - hold `Fn`, then hold `RShift`
    - OR hold `RAlt`, then hold `RShift`
    - OR hold `CAPS Lock`, then hold `RShift`
- Toggle:
    - hold `Ralt`, then double tap `PgDn`

While on the Control Layer, you have the following available:

- `Q` - triple tap to `enter bootloader mode`
- `Z` - triple tap to `clear eeprom`

- `LCTL` - Swap Number row for Fn Keys (1 is F1 ... + is F12)
- `N` - Toggle NKRO
- `I` - Change Background Color HUE Down
- `O` - Change Background Color HUE Up
- `K` - Change Background Color SAT Down
- `L` - Change Background Color SAT Up
- `,` - Change Background Color VAL Down - RGB_VAD
- `.` - Change Background Color VAL Up - RGB_VAI
- `;` - RGB_SPD
- `'` - RGB_SPI
- `P` - RGB Matrix solid color
- `[` - RGB_RMOD
- `]` - RGB_RMD
- `\` - RGB_TOG -- this will turn off the colors, but still enable indicators

- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è - RGB_SPD
- ‚û°Ô∏è - RGB_SPI
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è - RGB_VAI
- ‚¨áÔ∏è - RGB_VAD


## üéâ Conclusion and Next Steps

**That's it!** You now should be able to flash the custom firmware using qmk toolbox.
